Introduction</h1>
<p>ACF is a C++ based, cross-plattform component framework, that was especially designed for creation of very complex, customizable and highly scalable applications. ACF follows the component-oriented programming paradigm and provides instruments to build software from reusable components and serves interfaces and concepts to create those components. ACF contains a set of libraries with implementations of most usefull design patterns, such Serialization, Model/Observer, Factory, Dependency Injection etc.. ACF implements a powerfull component concept and includes many well designed components, which you can directly use in your application. The UI-part of the framework is based on Qt library provided by Digia. ACF is open source and released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). See <a href="http://www.ilena.org">http://www.ilena.org</a> or write <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'inf'+'o@'+'ima'+'gi'+'ngt'+'oo'+'ls.'+'de'; return false;">info@<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>imag<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ingto<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ols.<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>de</a> or contact by Skype to ACF_infoline for further information about the ACF.</p>
<p>More theoretical considerations about the component-based development can be found at the following link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Basics"></a>
Basics</h1>
<p>The main idea behind ACF is to see each software product as a composition of components with clearly defined interfaces. Interface is also the only way for communication between components. The usual steps to implement a component are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A C++ interface must be defined.</li>
<li>A class that implements this interface must be created.There are several ways to make a "normal" C++ class to a ACF-Component, the simplest way is to derive from a corresponding basic implementation or use a generic macro. A component can have dependencies from other components (e.g. component <b>A</b> needs component <b>B</b> to realize some functionality) and can have attributes. Via attributes it is possible, to parameterize some behaviour aspects of the component. Another way to create a component is to combine more existing components into a composition. This composition is also perceived by the framework as a component. A component composition is created with the framework tool called <b>ACF Compositor</b>. ACF Compositor provides graphical editing for the component dependencies and attributes. The compositions are stored in so-called ARX files (we also call them registries).</li>
<li>After a component is implemented, it must be registered in a so called Package. Component packages are logical containers of components. There are two kinds of packages:<ul>
<li>For C++ based component the package is a DLL with special export interface.</li>
<li>For component compositions the package is a special folder in the file system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep the management component packages consistent, all kind of packages have the same file extension - ARP (ACF Registry Package).</p>
<p>If all the necessary components have been implemented, the application can be executed. There are two basic ways. A composition of components can be run directly by Framework-Runtime. However, this mechanism is usefull only in the prototyping stage. For the final application a different approach can be used. ACF provides a special source-code generator, which makes it possible to produce source code back from component compositions. The resulting source code is then compiled by the usual way. This has the advantage that during the runtime of the application no modules (DLLs) must be loaded.</p>
